## ðŸ—» Challenges faced

Initially our project was designed for TUI, but, we ran into various issues with the python module framework we were using. The framework allowed capabilities such as animations, mouse support, and open widgets all from inside the terminal. Now the issues experienced with this method was primarily due to unclear documentation as when incorporating two separate widgets they would consistently overwrite one another. Other UI printing errors continued arising the more we added to the project. Consequently we changed our approach to this project to a web app using HTML, JS, and CSS that we present to you today.
